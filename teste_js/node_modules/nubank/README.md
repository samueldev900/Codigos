## Install
```
yarn add nubank
# or
npm i --save nubank
```

# Usage
First of all you need to sign in to your account using your credentials:

```js
import createNuBank from 'nubank'
const NuBank = createNuBank()

NuBank.getLoginToken({
  password: 'i_luv_c4ts',
  login: 'YOUR_CPF', // no dashes nor dots!
}).then(response => console.log(`I'm in!`)) // just need to call this once

// After signing you can now fetch your whole feed
// since the very beginning of your relationship with NuBank <3

NuBank
  .getWholeFeed()
  .then(history => {
    // ... doing some neat personal analysis ...
    // ... jeez, too much money spent on candies and coffee ...

    // history is something like:
    [
     { description: 'Netflix Com',
       category: 'transaction',
       amount: 2290,
       time: '2016-09-06T09:22:00Z',
       title: 'serviÃ§os',

For NuBank for having such a great API!

their web app uses.
